# python-list
The following operations were implemented on a Python list:

1. **Create an empty list** called `my_list`.
2. **Append elements** `10, 20, 30, 40` to the list.
3. **Insert** the value `15` at the second position (index `1`).
4. **Extend** the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. **Remove** the last element from the list.
6. **Sort** the list in ascending order.
7. **Find and print** the index of the value `30`.
